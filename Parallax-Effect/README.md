# Parallax Effect

This project is a simple implementation of Parallax Effect. 

Parallax effects involve a websiteâ€™s background moving at a different speed than the foreground content. This visual technique creates an illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll. 




## Simple CSS things

Basic CSS, just mentioning here in case I forgot.

1. Center using Translate

    position : absolute;
    top : 50%;
    left : 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    
    (Values can have variations and yet same result based on how we do it.)
